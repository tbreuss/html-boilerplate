# HTML Boilerplate

This is my personal HTML boilerplate for prototyping or testing new ideas.

It is based on https://purecss.io.

Pure offers a set of small, responsive CSS modules that you can use in every web project.

## Installation

Simply download this repo and use it as a starter for whatever you're working on.
